# IoT LED Control Web App with Django

## What is this project?

This project demonstrates how to control an LED connected to an Arduino board using a Django web application. It aims to showcase the integration of hardware (Arduino) with a web framework (Django) for IoT applications.

## Why is it useful?

IoT (Internet of Things) projects are becoming increasingly popular, and this project provides a practical example of how to build a web-based interface to interact with hardware devices remotely. It can be used as a learning tool for understanding the fundamentals of IoT development and server-side web programming.

## Why do you need it?

If you're interested in learning how to combine Django, a powerful web framework, with hardware like Arduino for IoT applications, this project is an excellent starting point. It provides hands-on experience in setting up the necessary components, writing code to control hardware, and creating a user interface to interact with it.

## How to use it?

1. Install the required Python packages using `pip install django pyfirmata`.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer and upload the `StandardFirmata` sketch.
3. Adjust the port in the `views.py` file to match your Arduino board's port.
4. Start the Django development server with `python manage.py runserver`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
6. Use the provided buttons to turn the LED on and off.
